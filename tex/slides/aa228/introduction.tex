\begin{itemize}
    \item A POMDP\footnote{Partially observable Markov decision process. ``Partially observable'' is key in understanding beliefs.} is an MDP with \textit{state uncertainty}
    \item The agent receives an \textit{observation} of the current state rather than the true state (potentially imperfect observations)
    \item Using past observations, the agent builds a \textit{belief} of their underlying state
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Which can be represented by a probability distribution over true states
    \end{itemize}
