\begin{itemize}
    \item The objective in a POMDP is to maximize accumulated reward while interacting with the environment.
    \item Several methods to compute an optimal policy which maps \textit{beliefs} to \textit{actions}:
    \begin{itemize}
         \item One approach converts the POMDP into an MDP and applies dynamic programming.\footnote{Introducing an algorithm that is analogous to MDP value iteration.}
         \item Another approach represents policies as conditional plans or piecewise linear value functions over the belief space.
     \end{itemize}
