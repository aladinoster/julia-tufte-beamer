\begin{frame}{Algorithms for Updating Beliefs}

Various algorithms can update the current belief:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If the state space is \textit{discrete} (or certain linear Gaussian assumptions are met), then we can perform \textit{exact belief updates}:\footnote{Meaning we arrive at an analytical solution without approximations.}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Recursive Bayesian estimation
        \item Kalman filter
    \end{itemize}
    \item Otherwise, we can use approximations based on linearization or sampling:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Extended Kalman filter
        \item Unscented Kalman filter
        \item Particle filter
        \item Particle filter with rejection
        \item Injection particle filter
        \item Adaptive injection particle filter
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
